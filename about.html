          <p class="intro-text">
            Floodgate Academy is dedicated to providing world class technical education to people from underrepresented backgrounds. The founding team believes given the proper tools, support, and environment to learn, anyone can build the skills needed for a successful technical career.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
             We were very pragmatic about crafting an experience that relates to people from non-majority backgrounds, giving them the confidence to thrive in startup culture. Learning technical concepts is a difficult task by itself. By providing equipment, connectivity, food, transportation, and a modest stipend Floodgate provides the proper environment for our students to acquire skills.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-text">
             Classroom work is only one part of the Floodgate Academy experience. Simulations and project work will never be able to take the place of real world experience. That's why we partner with progressive tech companies to give our students on the job experience. Once our students graduate, they'll have the experience needed to be productive from day one.
